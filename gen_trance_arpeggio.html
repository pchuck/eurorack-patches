Performance Notes
<ul>
  <li>master clock rate is ~120</li>
  <li>Tides is in LFO mode producing bipolar oscillations <1Hz</li>
  <li>Lapsus fader 1 controls the frequency of the lead voice</li>
  <li>Lapsus fader 3 distorts the VCO output</li>
  <li>Melodicer gate inputs 1/2 are configured to reset rhythm and melody</li>
  <li>Melodicer cv1 controls the note range ceiling</li>
  <li>cv1 is receiving random voltages ~0-1.5V, at 1/16th, from PNW</li>
  <li>Melodicer note probability %: C (40), D# (50), F (50), G# (80), Bb (50)
